Texas Parks was my first foray into site development. The application is the capstone project of the “Web Developer Bootcamp” on Udemy and illustrates the technologies learned in the course. Texas Parks is a CRUD REST app built with Node.js, Express and MongoDB. Passport is used for user authentication and account creation. The final product is a straightforward “Yelp-like” site where a user can publish and comment on posts.
